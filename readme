Cloud Backup Services Using Python and AWS S3

Features:
• File Encryption: Encrypts files using the cryptography library before uploading them to S3.
• MySQL Database Backup: Dumps MySQL databases as SQL files and uploads them to S3.
• Automated Scheduling: Uses Python’s schedule library to automate periodic backups.
• Notifications: Sends success or failure notifications via AWS SNS.
• Error Handling: Includes retry mechanisms to handle failed backup operations.
• Performance Optimization: Efficiently handles large files and databases.

Prerequisites:
• Python 3.9 or higher
• AWS account with configured S3 and SNS services
• MySQL server installed locally or on a remote host
• Install required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt 

Configuration:
Python configuration:
pip install awscli
aws configure

AWS Configuration:
Edit config/aws_config.json with the AWS credentials:
{ "aws_access_key" :  " AWS ACCESS KEY ", 
"aws_secret_key" :  " AWS SECRET KEY ", 
"region":  " REGION " } 

Generate Encryption Key:
Run the following command to generate the encryption key:
python -m encryption.encryptor generate_key 
This creates the encryption_key.key file in the config/ directory.

How to Run the Project
• Place files for backup in the specified directory.
• Configure AWS and database settings in the config/ folder.
• Run the main script: python main.py 

Performance Overview:
• File Backup: Encrypts and uploads files of various sizes efficiently (1MB ~ 2.3 seconds, 100MB ~ 55 seconds).
• Database Backup: Dumps and uploads MySQL databases efficiently, with a 500,000-row database backup completing in 120 seconds.
• Resource Usage: Maintains reasonable CPU and memory usage during operations, scalable for larger datasets.

Future Improvements:
• Multi-Region Backups: Implement cross-region replication for enhanced reliability.
• User Interface: Develop a GUI for easier configuration and monitoring of backups.
• Incremental Backups: Add support for incremental database backups.
• Key Rotation: Enable automated rotation of encryption keys for better security.
